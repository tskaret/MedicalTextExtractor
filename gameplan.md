# Medical Text Extractor - Project Game Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the Medical Text Extractor application, which is designed to monitor screenshots, extract medical information using OCR, and provide easy access to medication administration instructions.

## Project Overview

The Medical Text Extractor is a background application that:
- Monitors for screenshots
- Uses OCR to extract text from images
- Identifies Norwegian medical terms such as "rekvirent" (prescriber) and "Legemiddel" (medication)
- Extracts and stores administration instructions
- Provides clipboard functionality to paste the extracted information

## Completed Tasks

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Created project directory: MedicalTextExtractor
- ✅ Created a dedicated conda virtual environment: med_text_env with Python 3.9
- ✅ Installed required packages:
- opencv-python - for image processing
- pillow - for image manipulation
- pyautogui - for screenshot detection and automation
- pynput - for keyboard/mouse monitoring
- pyperclip - for clipboard operations
- pytesseract - Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR

### Core Components
- ✅ Created screenshot_monitor.py - Detects screenshots using keyboard monitoring
- ✅ Created ocr_processor.py - Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR
- ✅ Created text_analyzer.py - Identifies medication information in extracted text
- ✅ Created database/db_manager.py - Stores and retrieves medication information
- ✅ Created clipboard_manager.py - Manages copying data to the clipboard
- ✅ Created main.py - Integrates all components and provides CLI interface

## Current Status

The application has a functional architecture with all major components implemented. The current implementation allows for:
- Background monitoring of screenshots
- OCR processing of captured images
- Text analysis to extract medication information
- Database storage of extracted information
- Clipboard functionality for copying information
- Command-line interface for basic interaction

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Integration and Bug Fixes
- ✅ Update the `clipboard_manager.py` interface to match what's used in `main.py`
- ✅ Ensure `TextAnalyzer.analyze()` method exists (currently we have `analyze_text()`)
- ✅ Update `DatabaseManager` to include the `store_medication_info()` and `search_medications()` methods 
- ✅ Implement the `close()` method in `DatabaseManager`

### 2. Configuration and Error Handling (Priority)
- [x] Create a configuration system (config.py or settings.json)
- [x] Enhance error handling throughout the application
- [x] Improve logging configuration with rotation and appropriate log levels
- [x] Create a separate schema.sql file for database initialization

### 3. System Integration and User Experience
- [x] Add system tray integration for Windows
- [x] Improve user feedback mechanisms
- [x] Create a basic startup/shutdown service
- [x] Add error notifications for the user
### 4. Testing
- [x] Create unit tests for each component
- [x] Perform end-to-end testing of the complete workflow
- [ ] Test with various medication information formats
- [ ] Performance testing under different conditions

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation:
- [ ] Installation guide
- [ ] User manual
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting section

### 6. Build and Deployment
- [ ] Create an installation script
- [ ] Bundle the application into a Windows executable
- [ ] Add auto-start functionality for system boot

## Future Enhancements

### 1. User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface
- [ ] Create a history viewer for detected medications
- [ ] Add user preferences and customization options

### 2. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement export functionality for various formats
- [ ] Add support for multiple languages beyond Norwegian
- [ ] Create cloud backup options for the database
- [ ] Implement advanced text recognition with AI/ML models
- [ ] Add support for PDF document analysis

### 3. Integration Possibilities
- [ ] Create plugins for electronic health record systems
- [ ] Develop mobile companion app
- [ ] Implement secure sharing of extracted information
