# Medical Text Extractor - Project Game Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the Medical Text Extractor application, which is designed to monitor screenshots, extract medical information using OCR, and provide easy access to medication administration instructions.

## Project Overview

The Medical Text Extractor is a background application that:
- Monitors for screenshots
- Uses OCR to extract text from images
- Identifies Norwegian medical terms such as "rekvirent" (prescriber) and "Legemiddel" (medication)
- Extracts and stores administration instructions
- Provides clipboard functionality to paste the extracted information

## Completed Tasks

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Created project directory: MedicalTextExtractor
- ✅ Created a dedicated conda virtual environment: med_text_env with Python 3.9
  - Environment location: d:\Conda.env\med_text_env
  - **Note: All scripts should be run using this environment**
- ✅ Installed required packages:
- opencv-python - for image processing
- pillow - for image manipulation
- pyautogui - for screenshot detection and automation
- pynput - for keyboard/mouse monitoring
- pyperclip - for clipboard operations
- pytesseract - Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR
- win10toast - for Windows toast notifications

### Core Components
- ✅ Created screenshot_monitor.py - Detects screenshots using keyboard monitoring
- ✅ Created ocr_processor.py - Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR
- ✅ Created text_analyzer.py - Identifies medication information in extracted text
- ✅ Created database/db_manager.py - Stores and retrieves medication information
- ✅ Created clipboard_manager.py - Manages copying data to the clipboard
- ✅ Created main.py - Integrates all components and provides CLI interface

## Current Status

- ✅ Implement service-like operation with PowerShell scripts

### 5. Testing
- ✅ Create unit tests for each component
- ✅ Perform end-to-end testing of the complete workflow
- ✅ Test with various medication information formats
- ✅ Fix clipboard monitor service issues:
  - ✅ Debug OCR processing in the clipboard monitor
  - ✅ Ensure text analysis correctly identifies medication information
  - ✅ Verify file creation permissions and paths
  - ✅ Add more detailed logging for troubleshooting
- [ ] Performance testing under different conditions

## External Requirements
- Tesseract OCR for Windows needs to be installed from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Add Tesseract to system PATH after installation
- Conda environment med_text_env must be set up at d:\Conda.env\med_text_env
- The following packages must be installed in the conda environment:
  - opencv-python
  - pillow
  - pyautogui
  - pynput
  - pyperclip
  - pytesseract
  - win10toast
  - pystray (for system tray icon)
  - pywin32 (for Windows API access)

## Running the Application

### Environment Setup

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_conda_env.ps1

# Activate the conda environment
.\activate_env.bat
```

### Running the Clipboard Monitor Service
```powershell
# Start the service
.\start_clipboard_service.ps1

# Check service status
.\check_clipboard_service.ps1

# Stop the service
.\stop_clipboard_service.ps1
```

### Running the Enhanced Clipboard Monitor
```powershell
# Start the enhanced monitor with system tray icon
python start_enhanced_clipboard_service.py
```

### Manual Processing
```powershell
# Process a specific image file
python process_image.py path/to/image.png

# Process the current clipboard image
python process_clipboard_image.py
```

### Database Management
```powershell
# Add a new medication to the database
python add_medication_improved.py

# View all medications in the database
python view_medications.py
```

## Troubleshooting

If the clipboard monitor is not detecting images or extracting text correctly:

1. Check that Tesseract OCR is installed and configured correctly
2. Verify the conda environment is activated before running scripts
3. Look at the log files (clipboard_monitor.log) for error messages
4. Try running the debug scripts to test specific components:
   - debug_clipboard_monitor.py - Test clipboard image detection
   - test_format_analyzer.py - Test text analysis functionality
5. Ensure the image quality is good enough for OCR processing
6. Check that the medication database has entries for the medications you're looking up
